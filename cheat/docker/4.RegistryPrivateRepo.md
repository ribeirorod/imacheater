## Docker Registry 

Docker images are stored in a registry. The default registry is Docker Hub.

To access your public images on Docker Hub you must pass your user/image name to the docker run command. 
 `docker run user/image`  <!--translates to docker.io/user/image -->

### Private Registry

1. To access your private images you must first login to the registry. 
 `docker login registry.example.com` 
    ```bash
    Username: user
    Password:
    ```
2. Then you can pass your user/image name to the docker run command. 
 `docker run registry.example.com/user/image` 

### Deploying a private registry on premises

Docker registry is another application and it is available as a docker image. 
The name of the image is `registry` and it exposes the API on port 5000.

`docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart=always --name registry registry:2`

Now we have a private registry running on our host. We can push and pull images to and from this registry.
Using the tag `image` command to tag the image with the private registry url in it.

`docker image tag my-image localhost:5000/my-image`  

`docker push localhost:5000/my-image` <!-- To push the image the registry-->

From this point on, we can pull the image from the private registry any where in this network.
`docker pull localhost:5000/my-image` 

If from another host in the environment, we use the ip address of the host running the registry.
`docker pull 192.168.56.100:5000/my-image`
