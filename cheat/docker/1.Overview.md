### Port Mapping

Every docker container get its own IP address
`docker run -p 80:5000` | Docker host on 80 mapped to 5000 on the docker network

### Persist data with volume mapping
Docker container has its own file system, which gets erased at every restart cycle

`docker run -v /opt/data/dir:/var/lib/mysql mysql`
